### Key Design Decisions

1. **FlatList over ScrollView**: Virtualized list for better performance with large datasets
2. **useMemo for filtering**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations on re-renders
3. **Component-based architecture**: Small, reusable, testable components
4. **TypeScript interfaces**: Type-safe data structures prevent runtime errors
5. **Platform-specific styles**: Optimal UX on web vs native where needed
6. **Color-coded activity types**: Quick visual recognition
7. **Status-based prioritization**: Most urgent activities shown first
